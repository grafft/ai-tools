/**
 * The Spatial Pooler is responsible for creating a sparse distributed

 * etc.
 * <p>
 * The primary public interfaces to this function are the "initialize"
 * and "compute" methods.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <p>
 * SpatialPooler sp; <p/>
 * sp.initialize(inputDimensions, columnDimensions, <parameters>);<p/>
 * while (true) {<p/>
 * <get input vector><p/>
 * sp.compute(inputVector, learn, activeColumns)<p/>
 * <do something with output><p/>
